# LR1110 modem tracker sdk

## 1. Description

The LR1110 modem tracker SDK project contains the tracker application and several simple examples highlighting lr1110 modem tracker features :

Tracker application :
-	The app joins automatically the network then periodically :
	- Perform a Wi-Fi Scan
	- Perform a GNSS scan, the alcsync is needed
	- Collect data from sensor , MCU and Modem
	- Stream the scan results	
	- Can be configured through BLE
Simple LoRaWAN Class A application 868/915 MHz:
-	The app joins automatically the network then sends uplinks periodically
Simple GNSS example :
-	The unix date in ASCII is asked to the user through a terminal, once the date is received by the modem, it executes a GNSS scan periodically according to the gnss settings defined in the application
Simple Wi-Fi example :
-	The modem executes a Wi-Fi scan periodically according to the Wi-Fi settings defined in the application
Simple Tx continuous app :
-	The modem starts to send continuous wave
Simple BLE standalone app :
-	The tracker starts and stays in BLE
Update modem firmware :
-	Update trx to modem / modem to modem / modem to trx
Read internal log :
-	Read the internal log and send them by UART

## 2. Build & Install

To build the host softwares, proceed as follow:

-	use the Keil project, or
-	execute the makefile (in gcc folder)

-	LR1110 modem driver update and upper layers according to it

Known limitations:

-	unstable behavior on V2B hardware
-	not working on TTN: TTN v2 US non functional (requires stack 1.0.2, modem uses 1.0.3). running on TTNv3, but TTNv3 not released. Not corrected by R&D. Not confirmed: different

### V 0.1.1 ###

-	Set/Get Region BLE command supported in the firmware and compliant with smartphone app V1.6
